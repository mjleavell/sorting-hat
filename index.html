      <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Hogwarts!</h1>
      <p class="lead">Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find
        A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting
        Hat And I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see, So try me on and I will
        tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve
        and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient
        Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit
        and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk
        use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! You’re in safe hands
        (though I have none) For I’m a Thinking Cap!</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>I originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, but all the Hogwarts founders, Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin,
        Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff bewitched it for Sorting purposes.</p>
